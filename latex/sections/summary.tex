After seven years at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I am looking for new challenges.

I have actively contributed to bridging the gap between infrastructure and developers by designing automation and self-service platforms that improved delivery speed, reliability, and developer experience.

I co-designed and delivered Squest, a self-service provisioning and automation platform that modernized our infrastructure management, eliminating low-value repetitive tasks and enabling teams to focus on higher-impact engineering work.
